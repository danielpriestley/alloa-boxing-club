                Kelly started boxing at the age of 38. Kelly was always into fitness and wanted to give boxing a try.
                Once she did there
                was no going back, winning the Scottish Novice title and winning 5 out of her 6 bouts before she hit the
                maximum age
                limit. Although she had to retire from competitive fighting she still loved the sport so she decided to
                get into
                coaching to help encourage more females to get involved with boxing.
